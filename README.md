[CurseForge Page](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement-reborn)

This fork adds support for versions 1.19.4-1.20.1
The version numbers are continuing from the original [Accurate Block Placement](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement) mod.
This is a client side mod made for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) but also works with [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org). 
[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required.

**[WARNING]** This mod could get you banned on some servers with anti-cheats!
>This includes (but is not whatsoever limited to) Hypixel & most competitive servers.

In vanilla Minecraft, if you hold right-click with blocks, the game will place a block every 4 ticks. This means that if you try to place a row of blocks, you might miss some blocks or place too many. This mod fixes both problems, as seen in the GIF below.
You can set a keybind to toggle this mod on or off.

**NOTE:**
This mod is not to be confused with the [Tweakeroo](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo)/[Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) feature of the same name, which is a completely different thing. 

There is another mod called [Precise Block Placing](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/preciseblockplacing) which has a similar goal to this mod, but works very differently.
